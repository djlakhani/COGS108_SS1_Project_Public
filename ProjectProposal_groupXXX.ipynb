    "Our research question aims to determine if hosting the Olympics truly beneficial for a city or country. Although we have not finalized our question, we will choose from the potential questions below based on the data we are able to obtain:\n",
    "\n",
    "- (1) What is the scope of the economic impact of the Olympics across countries over time? Are these changes significant? Are these changes sustained? To what extent does economic impact affect societal quality (employment rate, literacy rate, etc.) of life within the host cities?\n",
    "- (2) Do host cities in developed countries enjoy larger profit margins (revenue generated by the games - total expenses) compared to cities in underdeveloped countries that choose to host the olympics?\n",

    "  The Olympics is an athletic competition hosted by a country every four years that brings spectators and travelers from all over the world to see their favorite countries competing. To look good to the international community, countries will often invest millions in hosting the event and the surrounding communities. After the pressure is off of the hosting country, it is unsure whether a country economically benefits from the event or stagnates due to debt.\n",
    "There are a couple articles and scientific journals published that talk about this topic. One study found that “regional per capita GDP significantly increases by 3.6 %-points (3.3 %-points) relative to national per capita GDP in the year of the event (the year before the event)” [^Firgo2021]. On the other hand, another article said that the games “provide little in return” [^Vassalo2021] and affect the impoverished the most, but there doesn’t seem to be references to data to back up these statements.\n",
    "\n",
    "  In line with the varying perspectives on the economic impact of hosting the Olympics, further research provides further insight into the subject. While hosting the Olympics can lead to short-term economic growth through increased tourism and infrastructure development, it also comes with substantial costs and uncertain long-term benefits. For instance, the 2016 Rio Olympics generated an estimated 1.8 billion dollars in tourism-related spending, showcasing the potential economic benefits [^Wills2021]. However, the 2012 London Olympics had a total budget of approximately 14.6 billion dollars, highlighting the significant financial investment required [^Wills2021].\n",
    "The need for careful planning, financial management, and a clear strategy for post-Olympic use of facilities is essential to ensure that the long-term economic benefits outweigh the costs associated with hosting such a massive event. These statistics demonstrate the complex nature of the economic impact of hosting the Olympics, indicating the importance of a comprehensive analysis considering both short-term gains and long-term sustainability. All in all, there are many different opinions on this topic and there are many different, unexplored avenues to answer this question, such as through a human/economic lens.\n",

    "Since we have not finalized our question, below are the potential hypothesis for each question: \n",
    "\n",
    "- Upon completion of literature review, our current research hypothesis is that though the Olympics may impact employment rate, in regards to the long term sustainability, the employment rate will fall and stabilize closer to pre-Olympic levels. Respectively, our null hypothesis for question (1) is that the Olympics will have no effect on employment, with no statistically significant increase or decrease in the employment rate of the host city in comparison to its pre-Olympic employment rate. Our alternative hypothesis is that the Olympics increase the employment rate in the pre-olympics and post-olympics period in host cities.\n",
    "- For question (2) our null hypothesis is that the differences in the profits earnt by the each of host cities is insignificant, while the alternative hypothesis is that developed host cities enjoy larger profit margins."

    "The ideal dataset would be a yearly dataset with columns consisting of a country, year, GDP, employment rate, inflation, healthcare coverage, poverty rate, and more factors if possible. Each country that has hosted the Olympics would have 5 observations (one for each year). Two observations are 2 years before the olympics, one for one year for the olympics, and two for 2 years after the olympics. This will allow us to properly see the economic state of a country before and after the olympics. There are 53 Olympic Games in total, so there will be 265 observations total. This data would have to be compiled from multiple datasets. We will need a dataset that contains the olympic info like year and country. The economic data will contain country, years, and economic data, which can be found on many websites, such as data.worldbank.org/country, wikipedia.org, and oecd.org. \n",
    "Specific datasets like “Revenues and Costs of the Olympic Games and the Football World Cups, 1960s to late 2010s” by Müller et al. (2022) will be highly useful in our project as well. Each of these sites contains comprehensive data on both general economic data (such as employment, inflation, and poverty rates) but additionally on more specific, social data (such as education, literacy, and migration rates). These kinds of websites’ data will be scraped for use within our project. The data would be merged together to form a rectangular dataset. This data would be stored as a csv file and organized by a unique key of country/year.\n"
